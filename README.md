# BedHead

An alarm clock app that plays any song on Youtube (for now). The sound will only stop when the user takes a selfie on the app, with their tooth brush in their mouth.

Goals: 
  - Make it a social media type thing, where friends can add each other on Bed Head and see their friends when they first wake up.
  - Not everyone brushes their teeth first in the morning, so eventually add alternatives to brushing teeth
      - Putting on clothes
      - On the toilet
  - Sell to toothbrush company
  - Opens spotify, Apple Music, or Youtube? See how other alarm apps manage
